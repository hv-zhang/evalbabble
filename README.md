# Babbling Evaluation with Reinforcement Learning

For ORIE 6125 Final Project: 

Team member: Vivian Hanwen Zhang

Short motivation: I will train a supervised reinforcement learning algorithm, which approximates caregiver evaluation of babbling and provides feedback. I will examine whether the artificial babbler improves its vocalizations based on the algorithm's feedback. 

Description of expected deliverables: Complete and working notebook of codes, and a short write up. 

Description of tools: version control with git, HTML doc & visualization of the project
